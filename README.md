# Sample Django Website - Asgard

In this project, I have created a Django app with an HTML/JavaScript Front end and a database. 
The following are the properties of the framework : 
1. The database contains a simple list of objects with associated information.  
2. The backend (in Django) communicates with the front end  
3. On clicking the button, the text snippet get displayed.
